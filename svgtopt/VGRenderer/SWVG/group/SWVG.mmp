//By default, the build tools look for the WINSCW def file in a BWINS directory
//(at the same level as the directory containing the mmp file), 
//the GCC ARM def file in a BMARM directory, and the ARMV5 def file in a EABI directory. 
//If def files are stored in these locations, the project files does not need to specify
//the location of the def files explicitly. If you want to store the def files in some other 
//location, you will need to specify in the project file where the .def files are using 
//the deffile keyword.

//The following commented out code shows how the build system uses the implicit
// location for defiles. To create the DEF files Choose Project > Freeze Exports from Carbide
// or run 'abld freeze' from the command-line
