VGRenderer is the interface class which interfaces with the underlying 3 renderer classes - TLV , Software and Hardware renderers.

TLV Renderer Class - This class captures the openvg command sequence into a encoded form of TLV(Type-Length-Value)command buffer and fills 
into an Extended CFbsBitmap. This extended bitmap is returned back to the calling method. It would be redundant to mention that TLV renderer class
doesnot interface with Openvg or EGL in any form.

Software Renderer class - Traditional software renderer which interfaces with Openvg and renders content using software renderer.Makes use of
VG and VGI calls for its job.

Harware Renderer Class - Hardware renderer which makes use of hardware openvg APIs in combination with EGL APIs.The context information is created
and maintained by egl in this case.Please look out for the TRUE return value of any egl function(eglcreate..eglget) as eglGetError might return an
EGL_SUCCESS even if an egl function returns FALSE.

EGL and Openvg have to be compiled before compiling VGRenderer
VGRenderer has to be compiled before compiling SVGEngine or AknIcon.
